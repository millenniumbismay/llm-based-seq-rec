      "    Based on the user's movie watching history and preferences, they have shown a fondness for movies that are thought-provoking, emotionally intense, visually stunning, and feature complex characters. While The Muppet Movie (1979) is a delightful musical adventure, it does not necessarily align with the user's preferred genres or themes.\n",

Additionally, the movie features a unique and visually appealing world, which may appeal to the user's appreciation for visual storytelling.\n",
