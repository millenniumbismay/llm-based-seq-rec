The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that the lifespan of the rubber pieces at the end of the band is Very short and you have no way of getting a replacement, because they are not sold separately. I took mine off and I wear the watch with no rubbers at the ends, its not that ugly you cant even tell actually. All the same Im happy with my purchase, I would recommend it.\"]})"

They provide a unique product at a reasonable price (usually with free shipping because of the quantities I order). So comfortable and of good quality. A button may of fell off here or there but always came with them all and very easy to sew back on. I do not dry any of their clothing; and because of this- the clothes never lose their shape or color.
