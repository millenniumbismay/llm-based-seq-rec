The back light works very well, the shine/glitter it has is beautiful, it doesn't look like too much. It is easy to put on and take off, perfect for workouts. The only bad thing I have to say about this product is that the lifespan of the rubber pieces at the end of the band is Very short and you have no way of getting a replacement, because they are not sold separately. I took mine off and I wear the watch with no rubbers at the ends, its not that ugly you cant even tell actually. All the same Im happy with my purchase, I would recommend it.\"]})"

This is a midweight pull-on shift dress with no buttons, zippers, or lining. The feel of the fabric is like a stretchy gym tank top. That being said, I think I could have fit into a medium since there is stretch, provided I wear some control undergarments such as Spanx. The XL was not too big but instead of hugging my body, it skims it with some room to spare. With the XL, I get a little bit of bunching around the small of the back and some flutter around my legs. All in all, with my size and body type, I think I would be most comfortable with the L.\\n\\nOn terms of print and color, I think this is a dress that can be worn all seasons, because while the print has some tropical elements in it, the colors range from blue to purple to black, so it won\\'t look out of place in colder months. The print also camouflages areas that some people might feel conscious about--like their waist and thighs. It is visually lengthening and slimming.\\n\\nI think this dress is a win because it is forgiving, just pick the right size. It does not wrinkle so it is good to take on a travel.

      "[\"These rings are wonderful quality and at a great price. I have been spending $30 at my local mall for only two rings... talk about a rip-off. These rings are exactly as shown in the picture. This is a 10 piece stainless steel assorted colors belly ring pack with cubic zirconia. I am allergic to nickel so stainless steel is a must. I have been wearing them for about a week now and have not had any problems. The colors of the gems are beautiful. The purple gem is lighter than shown in the product description, but still a pretty color. The only cons I have was the amount of time it takes to get here. I ordered these September 3 and received them October 10. I could not track the package because the number provided was not able to be tracked in the US. But shipping was free so I can't complain. They seem to be good quality and arrived within the scheduled dates. I am happy with my product and I would say it is definitely worth the money.\", \"Came in a beautiful velvet bag, all colors as shown with the exception of the pale yellow topaz pictured. It's actually a much more vibrant citrine color that I like better. No wiggly gems or anything. Definitely worth the money and I'm very happy with them. Do sanitize before you wear them though, as with any jewelry you buy from anywhere ever.\", \"They fit great,and don't slip down. Perfect for my Taos tennis shoes.\", 'My favorite no show socks that I own, ordered em twice!', \"I just got these as back up parts mostly for my favored pieces. Occasionally, the dangled pieces come loose, and sometimes fancier belly jewelry doesn't come with a matching upper jewel, so I swap out the plain jewel for the like color, and this assortment has every color. These look good to wear as is too.\\n\\nA few were a bit stiff to twist off at first. I just covered them with a cloth and gently used needle nose pliers to loosen them up. No problems after that.\", \"It can be hard to find something for me because I have sensitive skin. This product came as described and they are perfect. The gauge is a little big but nothing you can't get used to.\", 'Nice quality sock, thicker material without being bulky like a fleece blanket. Washes well in cold water. $12.99 is a great price for 6 socks of this quality.']\n",
      "['The set I received had a light pink instead of the violet, and the orange is much darker than the lovely light topaz shown. I do see now that the product description includes 11 colors and \"etc.\" but it\\'s not clear that you will receive 10 random colors which may or may not be the ones pictured.\\nI had the same problem others did with the tops not coming off - the clear, light pink, and dark blue. Overall they look nice and are a reasonable quality for the price - cheaper than buying individually - but I bought this set mostly for the clear and clear iridescent ones, and I can\\'t use the clear one, so that\\'s disappointing.']\n",

To take care of the wrinkles in the purse I have shoved socks in there to capacity for two weeks now. I have no used it yet and I actually might just give it away.

Get what you pay for I guess.', 'Fit more like a medium than a one size fits all.', \"I mainly wanted this for a swim suit cover-up. I'm very modest and when I go to the membership pool I wear a cover-up between the shower and pool and back again. I didn't realize that it had an inside liner until I put it on. I have a large bust and it fits me ok but the liner is a little tough to pull down, especially when I'm wet. Plus the arm holes are pretty small. A reviewer mentioned a front a back and at least on the one I got the liner is the same length on both sides so it could be put on either way.\\n\\nAt first I was planning on cutting out the liner so it would be easier to get on and off, but I'm still debating that. After I get out of the pool and shower I put this on and it's now a blouse. I kind of like the look and if I took the liner out I would not wear it as a blouse; it's very see through (hence the liner).\\n\\nThe one is have is called pink, I don't know why because the only pink in it is a flower; it's definitely orange (4 1/2 stars). I do like it as both a cover-up and as a blouse.\\n\\n{Sample provided for review}\", \"Man I had a hard decision to make about this top- should it be a 3 or a 4?\\n\\nWell, I went with a 3- but let me tell you, if I was rating it wearing it backwards it would be a 4.  Yes, I realize how weird that sounds- but I got the pink one, and the liner isn't substantial enough to prevent bra show through EXCEPT, if you put it on backwards the floral pattern is on top, and does sufficiently obscure the bra.  IMO, its cuter that way too.  I first put it on backwards by mistake.  I liked it but was thinking, the print isn't going to be the same as you saw on the website (floral on bottom).  That is when I realized I had it on backwards (oops) and flipped it around.  Ok now it's just like online, but I don't like it as much because I have to be way more careful about what I put on under it.\\n\\nBeing polyester, despite its very thin wispy nature, it seems to retain heat.  It's not as cool as a normal tank top, temperature wise.\\n\\nHonestly, there isn't really a difference in shape front to back that I can tell, and I'll probably just wear it backwards!  I still wouldn't have given it a 5, because the liner isn't nearly as long as it should be in my opinion.  I don't like the early end leaving part see through, I know it's a fashion choice, but I just don't like it.  I think it would look prettier if more consistent throughout the length.  Like most clothes in this price range and especially of this cloth type, I worry about durability.  Hand wash or get a very fine mesh lingerie bag for best results.\\n\\nNow on size- I think I'm a little smaller than the target market for this shirt (description says Medium to Large, I'm a size 4, 32C) but it fits me OK, it's not way too big but it is a little wide on the torso, a hair wider than the style is designed to be.\\n\\nNow realistically, I worry for anyone with thick arms that this will be a bad choice.  I have very thin arms and have about an inch and a half or two to spare and there isn't really any give to them.  No stretch, either it'll fit comfortably or it won't at all.  I see another reviewer, size 16 mentioned she liked the fit but in her photos you can see she's not utilizing the arm holes.  I don't know if that was just that she didn't realize they were there or it did not fit comfortably, it's not addressed in her review.\\n\\nJust a heads up, because I also didn't notice them when I first put it on and there is a secondary area that feels like appropriate arm holes, The higher hole doesn't line up with the liner tank top so its easy to overlook when you put it on.  I was going to complain that the beautiful draping is actually in the way of getting anything done.  If you don't use the arm holes and use this secondary area, the shirt drapes over your hands, making cooking or eating in this shirt near impossible, not to mention you'd have a hell of a time in the restroom!  You want those higher arm holes to work for you unless you intend to stand pretty still all day.  Also, unless you are a sewing guru, it's going to look a little odd to have two stitched holes at about the height of your elbow just hanging out.\\n\\nI received a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.\"]\n",

These were purchased for my son, and the size was accurate and they look good on him.  Most pants tend to be baggy in the crotch or butt on him, because he is so skinny.  They fit well without relying on tying them at the waist, because the elastic waist is sized accurately - not one size fits all type of thing like some companies do.\\n\\nI am very happy with this purchase & my son really likes them.\\n\\nUpdate:  So, I went ahead and machine washed and dried these & they laundered fine - even softened up a bit.\", 'Not too bad I would have considered a size larger but it works for casual comfort.']\n",

I feel so great wearing this with some leggings! It\\'s flattering and doesn\\'t overly emphasize the fact that I\\'m carrying some extra weight. I love that it has a conservative neckline, too. The medium fits me great, if not a little big. I\\'m on the large end of being able to fit in medium shirts, if that helps. I am a true size 8, and am 5\\'8\" tall and it fits me like the model picture in length.',\n",

Personally it looks cute but I know this blouse was not meant to worn for years on end and in some regards I am okay with that.  This is a thin, lightweight sweater.  So if you are self-conscious about your bra showing, just wear a nude color or wear a camisole underneath.  Personally I am shameless so I don't care unless I am cold, then I would throw this over a shirt.\",\n",
